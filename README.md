# 3D-Cozy-Platformer
A cozy low-poly 3D platformer built in Godot. Players explore floating islands, collect coins, avoid enemies, and progress through two connected levels. The project reimagines a simple 2D platformer into a relaxing yet challenging 3D experience focused on creative level design and atmosphere.
